about: Report a bug in your deployed instance
---

## Deployment Information

```

## Example: Perfect GitHub Landing Page

When someone visits your repo, they should immediately see:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Grandillionaire / SelfStarterSuite                      │
│                                                         │
│ 🚀 Deploy your own AI council on Vercel (free). Five    │
│ legendary advisors debate your questions. Self-hosted   │
│ • No backend • Bring your own API keys                  │
│                                                         │
│ [Deploy to Vercel Button]                              │
│                                                         │
│ Topics: ai • anthropic • self-hosted • vercel •         │
│         bring-your-own-key • nextjs                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Then README starts with:

⚠️ THIS IS NOT A HOSTED SERVICE
This is a self-hosted, open-source project...
```

This makes it **impossible to miss** that it's self-hosted.

## FAQ Section for README

Add this to address common confusion:

### ❓ Common Questions

**Q: Is there a website I can visit?**
A: No! You must deploy your own instance first. Click the "Deploy to Vercel" button above.

**Q: Do you host this for me?**
A: No, each user deploys their own private instance. It's free and takes 2 minutes.

**Q: Who pays for the AI?**
A: You do (directly to Anthropic). You bring your own API key. ~$0.03 per debate.

**Q: Can I use this without deploying?**
A: No, there's no shared instance. This is self-hosted software.

**Q: Is it really free?**
A: Hosting is free (Vercel). You pay only for AI API usage (~$0.03/debate).

**Q: Do I need to know how to code?**
A: No! Just click the deploy button and follow the 4 steps above.

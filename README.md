### ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is there a website I can visit to use this?**
A: ❌ No! There is no hosted version. You must deploy your own instance first (takes 2 minutes, free).

**Q: Do you host this for me?**
A: ❌ No. Each user deploys their own private instance to their own Vercel account.

**Q: Who pays for the AI?**
A: You do, directly to Anthropic. You bring your own API key (~$0.03 per debate, $5 free credit to start).

**Q: Can I use this without deploying?**
A: ❌ No. This is self-hosted software, not a web service.

**Q: Is the hosting really free forever?**
A: ✅ Yes! Vercel's free tier is generous and permanent. You only pay for API usage.

**Q: Do I need to know how to code?**
A: ✅ No! Just click the "Deploy to Vercel" button and follow the 4 steps. No coding required.

**Q: What about my data privacy?**
A: ✅ All data stays in YOUR browser's localStorage. Nothing is sent to our servers (we don't have any!).

**Q: Can other people use my deployed instance?**
A: ⚠️ Your Vercel URL is public, but rate limiting prevents abuse. Keep your URL private if you prefer.
